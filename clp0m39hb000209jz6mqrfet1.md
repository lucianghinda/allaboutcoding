I discovered this [Reddit thread on /r/rails](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j) and I thought it would be a good idea to pick some of the things posted there in an article and also share it on my social media channels.

So the question they asked there was the following:

> **Anyone here use Rails to start their own business?**

Here are some answers that I picked from there.

### [airnoise.io](https://airnoise.io)

*"The fast, easy way to file airport noise complaints"*

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700031763105/9e0578aa-5b90-454a-a076-544bf211cc44.png align="center")](https://airnoise.io)

[His creator](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j/comment/k8npo1j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) describes it as:

[!["It‚Äôs been live for over seven years. I‚Äôve got several thousand users and the system has processed over 15 million noise complaints. It‚Äôs mainly hosted on Heroku and AWS though I‚Äôm investigating using Kamal to Dockerize everything to run it more cheaply. It still pays for itself, though. My biggest issue is simply updating the app to the latest Rails version, which would have been easier incrementally but here we are! Whatever your idea ‚Äî just build it and launch it. If you know Rails, use that. Do not agonize over whether or not it‚Äôs the perfect or even best platform, just build the damn thing and the rest will work itself out. Don‚Äôt wait. Start now. And have fun!"](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700031902608/b4ab69e4-c019-4f54-a7f5-104b1680083d.png align="center")](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j/comment/k8npo1j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I want to add here that by looking at what people share online, the upgrades are easier and easier. Also now Shopify and Github along with Basecamp are I think running on Rail's main branch so the upgrade should be way easier

### [saashub.com](https://www.saashub.com/)

*"Software Alternatives And Reviews"*

### [libhunt.com](https://www.libhunt.com)

*"Discover trending open-source projects and their alternatives"*

Both projects SaasHub and LibHunt are created by the same developer. Here is they say about these projects:

[!["ü§ö I‚Äôm running SaaSHub, LibHunt (both 1mm+ monthly visits), and some other websites. It‚Äôs been a full-time business for a few years now. I‚Äôm the single dev, and I can‚Äôt imagine doing it without Rails! Some Rails productivity context - My SaaSHub competitors only, e.g. G2 or ProductHunt, have teams of dozens of devs each."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700032208589/16066d8f-f224-4d11-8f1d-a1947b722cb7.png align="center")](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j/comment/k8oqodh)

[!["Each of them run on a single 8GB server (loaded at about 30-40%). There's CloudFlare as CDN. That's all. Everything else is pretty standard. Postgres and some Redis cache here and there."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700032235474/18c27aca-6109-42dd-a3b6-31ef75f0a69a.png align="center")](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j/comment/k8umc94)

I would add here that with the help of [litestack](https://github.com/oldmoe/litestack) you can start a Rails 7 project and host it all in one single Hetzner VPS. No extra servers are needed for DB, Cronjobs, or processing queues. Everything is in one single server.

### [radius.to](https://www.radius.to)

*"Radius is a platform for finding and organising events, both online and in person"*

Here is what [the creator says about](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j/comment/k8nc4wb) this project:

[!["Yep, using Rails to try and build a better alternative to meetup.com / Eventbrite - https://www.radius.to/ - been building it slowly for the last few years. Not yet launched so can't really call it a business. No idea if people other than me will use it but it's been a good project to learn more about Rails at the very least. I admire anyone who's able to launch a business whilst still employed, and without a large bucket of cash - it's tough work! Luckily though since I'm using Rails, code has been the easy part. The difficult bits have mostly been design/UX related"](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700032549523/8a472496-3997-4efc-a088-bf02adbd8057.png align="center")](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j/comment/k8nc4wb)

Here is what [the creator says about](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j/comment/k8n36yw) the project:

[!["I co-founded LogCheck about ten years ago. The product includes a native mobile app but the backend and web UI is a Rails app. The initial backend was written in PHP, because I was using a free hosting service, but when it was becoming a ‚Äúreal‚Äù thing, I replaced it with a Rails app (to this day, the mobile API URLs still end in .php). I picked Rails because I had some experience with it and it was more important to get something built than it was to ‚Äúhave fun‚Äù using something new. I spent the first few years mostly insulated from Javascript/Node/NPM drama and that probably helped the business. Unfortunately, we eventually integrated React because I was led to believe that was the right way to do highly interactive UI on the web. We only used it for a few components (like managing a graph view) but after the company got acquired our new parent got strict about security vulnerabilities and keeping all that junk upgraded soaked up a lot of time. If I were starting a new business today I‚Äôd use Rails and HTMX"](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700033176260/bf7cb54d-32df-48c3-ab27-f67003aad5f3.png align="center")](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j/comment/k8n36yw)

Here is what [the creator says about](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j/comment/k8o1ane) this project:

[!["Yup, I've been using Rails for over ten years now and love it. Just started Smartynames.com using Rails in January, and sold it in October. You should use whatever tools you know to achieve the outcome and not worry about what others thinks or say. The goal of the business is profit, and what gets you there is unimportant. Facebook was running on PHP for the first ten years of their operation, so really, you could use anything. That said, Rails is easy and snappy, and the latest edition with Hotwire tools is a joy to use. Whether or not it's the best choice, not always, but it doesn't matter much if you are just starting out."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700033293769/d7196c5b-9866-4b8f-8059-34b3192b4f54.png align="center")](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j/comment/k8o1ane)

[!["From the onset, it meant that Lectronz needed to adopt a lean tech stack, which allows any developer to be operational on both frontend and backend concerns, with minimal moving parts and third-party dependencies. A lean tech stack will also enable changes to respond to evolving demands. This drove us towards using Ruby on Rails, which offers a platform that enables small teams of developers to build full modern web applications in Ruby. The release of Rails 7 at the end of 2021 has marked the beginning of an exciting new era for Rails developers, making it the ideal lean tech stack for a web application today. As a result, we were able to built Lectronz with the equivalent of a single developper working part-time."](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1700033829546/e994f38c-73f4-4cc6-89eb-b38cce22316e.png align="center")](https://lectronz.com/u/lectronz/articles/a-peak-behind-the-curtain)

## Conclusion

I think you should [read the original thread on /r/rails](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/17s073j/anyone_here_use_rails_to_start_their_own_business/) there are more comments there than what I included there.

I just wanted to show the diversity of projects built with Ruby on Rails. I find it inspiring to look at these projects and ideas.
