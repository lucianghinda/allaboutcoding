A couple of projects or directories in the Ruby community are trying to aggregate companies or products using Ruby or Ruby on Rails. **If you are using Ruby or any Ruby-based framework in your company or for one of your projects, then I think you should add it to these websites as you see fit.**

These efforts are important for the community, as they provide a valuable resource for job seekers while offering inspiration and opportunities about what can be built with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

Moreover, it is equally good to show what kind of projects and companies can be built with Ruby / Ruby on Rails for anyone considering learning Ruby.

## [UsingRails.com](https://usingrails.com)

[https://usingrails.com](https://usingrails.com) is a project by [Andy Croll](https://andycroll.com) that contains organizations that use Ruby on Rails.

You can submit a website directly via the web interface at [https://usingrails.com/submissions/new](https://usingrails.com/submissions/new) after creating a new account.
