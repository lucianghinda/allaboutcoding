In the last month or so, I have only had a little time to write an article about Ruby, but I have shared some posts online. I still shared various technical posts online; I did not have time to expand them into a more extensive/deeper article.

It could be interesting to make a weekly summary of everything I write online each week. This would be an exercise in looking back and reviewing what I wrote about.

**Monday:** [**Short Ruby Newsletter - edition 113**](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/edition-113)

My week started (as it always starts) with publishing the Short Ruby Newsletter on Monday: [https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/edition-113](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/edition-113)

**Tuesday:** [**Three Ruby Links #8**](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/three-ruby-links-8)

I followed up on **Tuesday** with another series that I am starting that I call ‚ÄúThree Ruby Links‚Äù: [https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/three-ruby-links-8](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/three-ruby-links-8)

**Tuesday:** [**Choosing between a normal if and a modifier**](https://notes.ghinda.com/post/choosing-between-if-and-a-modifier)

Also, on Tuesday, I wrote a thread about Choosing between if and a modifier. I published this thread on all platforms, but there is also a written version of it: [https://notes.ghinda.com/post/choosing-between-if-and-a-modifier](https://notes.ghinda.com/post/choosing-between-if-and-a-modifier)

**Thursday:** [**My first contribution to ruby-lang.org was merged**](https://notes.ghinda.com/post/my-first-contribution-to-ruby-lang-org-website)

On Thursday, I shared the importance of contributing to Ruby's documentation, and I wanted to show that even a small contribution can help. Thus, I showed a small PR I submitted for the [ruby-lang.org](https://ruby-lang.org) website:

**Friday:** [**Script to display VCR body using** `jq`](https://notes.ghinda.com/post/script-to-display-vcr-body-using-jq)

On Friday, I wrote a thread about a script that I am using to display the body of a VCR cassette directly in the command line using a super useful linux utility called `jq`: [https://notes.ghinda.com/post/script-to-display-vcr-body-using-jq](https://notes.ghinda.com/post/script-to-display-vcr-body-using-jq)
