## Ruby and Rails info

If you want to discover more resources about Ruby and Rails I recommend to visit [https://rubyandrails.info](https://rubyandrails.info) that I maintain and try to add fresh resources as soon as they appear.

You should also subscribe to Short Ruby Newsletter at [newsletter.shortruby.com](https://newsletter.shortruby.com). It is a Monday morning summary of the articles, discussions, and news from the Ruby community. I watch a series of places like Twitter, ruby.socia[l](http://ruby.social), Reddit, Linkedin, Dev.to, Ruby LibHunt, and other news sources.
