As Ruby 3.3 is around the corner, I suggest a list of recommended articles or videos to watch to get up to date with Ruby's evaluation as a language.

This is a partial list of some of the things happening in Ruby. Still, I think it is an excellent start to glimpse how Ruby's programming language is evolving and how much effort the community puts into keeping Ruby a joy to use.

## Context

First, I recommend you watch this video where Matz is talking about how he chooses to include in Ruby and about Ruby future:

%[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MM5b2F9zrM] 

## New language syntax

Then I recommend you read the following series of articles (hint: They are not useless üòÄ )

* [That useless Ruby syntax sugar that emerged in new versions](https://zverok.substack.com/p/that-useless-ruby-syntax-sugar-that)
    
* [‚ÄúUseless syntax sugar‚Äù: Numeric block parameters](https://zverok.substack.com/p/useless-syntax-sugar-numeric-block)
    
* [‚ÄúUseless Ruby sugar‚Äù: Pattern matching (Pt. 1)](https://zverok.substack.com/p/useless-ruby-sugar-pattern-matching)
    
* "[Useless Ruby sugar‚Äù: Pattern matching (Pt. 2)](https://zverok.substack.com/p/useless-ruby-sugar-pattern-matching-cad)
    
* [‚ÄúUseless Ruby sugar‚Äù: Pattern matching (Pt. 3/3)](https://zverok.substack.com/p/useless-ruby-sugar-pattern-matching-891)
    
* [‚ÄúUseless Ruby sugar‚Äù: Keyword argument and hash values omission](https://zverok.substack.com/p/useless-ruby-sugar-keyword-argument)
    
* [‚ÄúUseless Ruby sugar‚Äù: Argument forwarding](https://zverok.substack.com/p/useless-ruby-sugar-argument-forwarding)
    
* [‚ÄúUseless Ruby sugar‚Äù: Endless (one-line) methods](https://zverok.substack.com/p/useless-ruby-sugar-endless-one-line)
    

## Performance

First, I would recommend you read about Object Shapes:

* [Object shapes - how this under-the-hood change in Ruby 3.2.0 will improve your code performance](https://poddarayush.com/posts/object-shapes-improve-ruby-code-performance/)
    
* [Performance impact of the memoization idiom on modern Ruby](https://railsatscale.com/2023-10-24-memoization-pattern-and-object-shapes/)
    
* [Writing Object Shape friendly code in Ruby](https://island94.org/2023/10/writing-object-shape-friendly-code-in-ruby)
    

Then I would recommend you read about YJIT:

* [YJIT Is the Most Memory-Efficient Ruby JIT](https://railsatscale.com/2023-11-07-yjit-is-the-most-memory-efficient-ruby-jit/)
    
* [Ruby 3.3's YJIT: Faster While Using Less Memory](https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-04-ruby-3-3-s-yjit-faster-while-using-less-memory/)
    
* [Ruby 3.2‚Äôs YJIT is Production-Ready](https://shopify.engineering/ruby-yjit-is-production-ready)
    

I think you could also [read a good article about Ractors](https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/ractors/) by Julie Kent or [watch a presentation about them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhPAMDdOnU0) by Abiodun Olowode.

## A more high-level overview

(A shameless plug) I would also recommend my presentation at [Friendly.rb](https://friendlyrb.com) this year about The State of the Rubyverse where I try to show various projects happening in Ruby world:

## Going deep into details

I would recommend you browse [https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/)

It contains a more detailed (with examples) list of changes per each Ruby version.

Then I would recommend the series called [Advent of Prism](https://kddnewton.com) from Kevin Netwon and also watch [this video from Takashi Kokubun about RJIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlcQ8DErvVs)
