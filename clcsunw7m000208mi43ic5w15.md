# Code Design Inertia

Code Design Inertia:

> The code that will be written in the future will follow the design of the code already written.

Inertia is stronger inside a file =&gt; the code added will follow the design of the code already written.

So going further with this metaphor, "consistency" is like gravity: the close you follow a guideline the harder will be to see the benefit of other ways to write code.
