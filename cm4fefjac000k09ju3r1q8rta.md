## Monday

Every Monday, I publish the Short Ruby Newsletter:

[Short Ruby Newsletter - edition 116](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/edition-116) - *The one where Rails World, Friendly.rb, and EuRuKo announced the dates for 2025 conferences, and Marco Roth announced* [*rubytriathlon.com*](http://rubytriathlon.com)

## Tuesday

I wrote and shared on social media a recommendation of two products for blogging made by two members of our Ruby community:

[Two recommendations if you want to start a blog](https://notes.ghinda.com/post/two-recommendations-if-you-want-to-start-a-blog)

## Wednesday

I finished an article I started during the weekend when I installed the [Writebook](https://once.com/writebook) for [booklet.goodenoughtesting.com](https://booklet.goodenoughtesting.com) where I shared how you can override a class method or instance method of a Ruby object used in a Ruby on Rails app:

[Overriding Methods in Ruby on Rails: A No-Code-Editing Approach](https://allaboutcoding.ghinda.com/overriding-methods-in-ruby-on-rails-a-no-code-editing-approach)

While not about Ruby, I also wrote a short note about how I included on my GoodEnoughTesting resources a link to the workshops:

[Using shoutouts.page to embed a link to my workshops](https://notes.ghinda.com/post/using-shoutouts-page-to-embed-a-link-to-my-workshops)

## Thursday

I expanded a reply to a question about returning multiple values from a Ruby method into an article where I recommended using Data object:

[How to Return Multiple Values from a Method in Ruby Using Data.define](https://allaboutcoding.ghinda.com/how-to-return-multiple-values-from-a-method-in-ruby-using-datadefine)

This is what I published this week about or around Ruby.

Next week, I will probably only publish the newsletter and maybe 3 Ruby Links as I will be focused on the [GoodEnoughTesting](https://goodenoughtesting.com) workshops.
