If you browse one of the latest editions of [Short Ruby News](https://newsletter.shortruby.com), you will notice that each one has a Community section and that is the first section of the newsletter.

Here is a short explanation of why I always include a Community section:

I think the community is as important as the code when I think about the Ruby language. They are both a side I love about Ruby and want to see it grow.

I find it inspiring to see new projects dedicated to the community or to see new events launched. I think we should support and encourage people that are doing projects that improve our community.

Events are a great way to form new connections and out of these connections, I am sure new things might come.
