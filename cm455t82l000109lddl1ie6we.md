### Monday

Every Monday, I publish the Short Ruby newsletter I create over the weekend:

[Short Ruby Newsletter - edition 115](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/edition-115)

Additionally, I also published a page with some discounts for my Good Enough Testing Workshop:

[Black Friday / Cyber Monday Deals for Good Enough Testing Workshop](https://goodenoughtesting.com/deals)

I started curating a list of deals for Ruby developers as well and I kept updating it every day while discovering new deals:

[Black Friday/Cyber Monday Deals for Ruby developers](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/deals-for-ruby-developers-2024)

### Tuesday

This has become a habit for me: I set aside a few long-form or interesting articles about Ruby while working on the newsletter over the weekend and choose three to recommend. This week’s recommendation is:

[Three Ruby Links #10](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/three-ruby-links-10)

On the same day, after upgrading my Ruby version to 3.3.6, I noticed that Neovim Ruby LSP was having trouble detecting the updated Ruby version. I found a fix and published a small article about it:

[When Neovim does not know the Ruby version](https://notes.ghinda.com/post/when-neovim-does-not-know-the-ruby-version)

### Wednesday

I published a how-to article on creating the deals link with a header animation for the [GoodEnoughTesting.com](http://GoodEnoughTesting.com) website:

[How to make a small pulsating animation in Rails using Tailwind](https://allaboutcoding.ghinda.com/how-to-make-a-small-pulsating-animation)

Additionally, I released the same content about making the header link pulsate as [a very short video on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8O3GjJKDiI). I'm unsure about it; it’s quite short, but I may extend it and provide more explanation while demonstrating the code

I also published an idea that writing articles about Ruby will not only help the community but also help LLM get better at suggesting Ruby code:

[Reminder to write articles about Ruby to have better LLM suggestions](https://notes.ghinda.com/post/reminder-to-write-articles-about-ruby-to-have-better-llm-suggestions)

### Thursday

I published two articles out of some notes I had for the GoodEnoughTesting workshop:

[Testing public methods vs private methods](https://booklet.goodenoughtesting.com/1/good-enough-testing-for-developers/2/testing-public-methods-vs-private-methods#testing-public-methods-vs-private-methods)

and

[Applied Test Case Design: Zammad example](https://booklet.goodenoughtesting.com/1/good-enough-testing-for-developers/3/applied-test-case-design-zammad-example)

I installed a [Writebook](https://once.com/writebook) and published these articles. While it needs a bit more polishing to suit my long-form blogging needs, it looks great right out of the box

### Friday

I published a new episode of my [Short Ruby podcast](https://podcast.shortruby.com) that I started a while back. I had some notes from a reply I composed to a question on Reddit and used them to create this episode:

[Sharing your knowledge as a path to mastery](https://podcast.shortruby.com/2417631/episodes/16192809-sharing-your-knowledge-as-a-path-to-mastery)

As I continue to publish written content, I'm finding it easier thanks to the notes I take during coding and while responding to questions about Ruby. However, producing a podcast episode and hearing my own voice still feels a bit out of my comfort zone. I need to practice more to feel comfortable.
