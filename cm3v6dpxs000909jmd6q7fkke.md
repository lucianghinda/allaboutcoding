### Monday

My week started (as it always starts) with publishing the Short Ruby Newsletter on Monday

[Short Ruby Newsletter - edition 114](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/edition-114)

### Tuesday

I followed up on **Tuesday** with another series that I am starting that I call ‚ÄúThree Ruby Links‚Äù

[Three Ruby Links #9](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/p/three-ruby-links-9)

### Wednesday

During my [GoodEnoughTesting](https://goodenoughtesting.com) workshops we discuss in the beginning expectations from the training. There is always an expectation about best practices when writing tests and I tried in this article to pin down some high-level simple rules that I try to apply when writing test code

[Tests should be simple](https://goodenoughtesting.com/articles/tests-should-be-simple)

### Thursday: 

This is a small post showing how to use pattern matching in Ruby to check if an array is empty, not empty, or has some specific kind of objects inside

[Using Pattern Matching in Ruby to act based on array contents](https://notes.ghinda.com/post/using-pattern-matching-in-ruby-to-act-based-on-array-contents)

### Friday

I was reading this article by Vladimir Dementyev and noticed an example of using RBS inline. Then I read the source code and noticed how he uses Prism to parse method definitions together with RBS type and generate function definitions for LLMs

[RBS inline code sample from Anycable example](https://notes.ghinda.com/post/rbs-inline-code-sample-from-anycable-example)
